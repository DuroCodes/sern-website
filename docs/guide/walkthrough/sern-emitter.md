# The SernEmitter class
You're shipped with the SernEmitter. This EventEmitter listens to
- command modules executing and its status, the `module.activate` event
- command modules registered and its status, the `module.register` event
- any errors that are recoverable, the `error` event

<br /> You can put these and other event listeners into event modules!
