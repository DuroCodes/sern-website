# Introduction 

Welcome to the sern's official guide. This guide will go through all the core features of the framework. <br>
Thank you for choosing sern to be your framework! <br>

**Disclaimers**: 
- Teaching the discord.js library and / or Javascript / Typescript is out of scope of this project, so the documentation assumes you already know these elements. <br>
- Sern is only available in ```discord.js@dev``` at the moment. There are plans to roll out a version of Sern in ```discord.js@13.xx.xx``` in the future.

# Goal

sern strives to be minimalist, but with all batteries included. Meaning, this framework provides the necessary tools
to start up a bot in minutes, and leaves plenty room space to customize your experience and create an amazing project. 
It should include all the tools for any bot at any scale.


# CLI

Setting up the [CLI](https://github.com/sern-handler/cli) is easy. <br>
- To start a brand new project, run : 
```
sern init (-y)
```
Include the `-y` flag if you want to set up defaults. The default langauge is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) <br>

- To install [plugins](todo) maintained by the community [repository](https://github.com/sern-handler/awesome-plugins), 
```
sern plugins
```
This will display a menu selection of all installable plugins. <br>
**Note**: You must have a [sern.config.json](todo) to use this command.
If you want to view plugins, visit the repository linked above.

- To install extra utilities into your project 
```
sern extra
```

# First Command
We will dissect a basic command. 
If you installed a new project via the cli, This is the `ping` command located in src/commands folder.

Typescript
```typescript
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler';

export default commandModule({
	type: CommandType.Both,
	plugins: [],
	description: 'A ping command',
	//alias : [],
	execute: async (ctx, args) => {
		await ctx.reply({ content: 'Pong üèì' });
	},
});
```
Javascript
```javascript
const { CommandType, commandModule } = require('@sern/handler');

exports.default = commandModule({
	type: CommandType.Both,
	plugins: [],
	description: 'A ping command',
	//alias : [],
	execute: async (ctx, args) => {
		await ctx.reply('Pong üèì');
	},
})
```
### Essential properties of a command

- **module.type** (Required)
  - The type of your module. For example, a command listening to messages would have the type CommandType.Text
- **module.execute** (Required)
  - This function is called when the command is triggered. Do your logic here!
- **module.name** (Optional)
  - Give your command a name. **(defaults to its filename)**
- **module.description** (Optional)
  - Give your command a description. **(defaults to `..`)**
- **module.plugins** (Optional)
  - A list of [plugins](todo) that will modify and change the behavior of your command. <br>
  
### Types of command modules
Every command module `type` is part of an enum. This field allows type inference for the rest of a module's fields. <br>
All available command types : 
```
CommandType.Text = A Text Command
CommandType.Slash = A Slash Command
CommandType.Both = A Command supporting either text or slash
CommandType.Modal = A Command listening to Modal interactions
CommandType.MenuSelect = A Command listening to select menu interactions
CommandType.MenuUser = A Command listening to context menu user interactions
CommandType.MenuMsg  = A Command listening to context menu message interactions
CommandType.Button = A Command listening to button interactions
```
So, lets say you want to make a command module that listens to modals. <br>
**Note**: Keep in mind you'll need to send a modal with a custom id `dm-me`. This example below is the response to a modal being sent.<br>

Typescript:
```typescript
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler';
export default commandModule({
        name: 'dm-me',
        type: CommandType.Modal,
        async execute (modal) {
            const value = modal.fields.getTextInputValue('message');
            modal.client.users.fetch('182326315813306368').then( u =>
                u.send(value + ` from ${modal.user}`)
            );
            modal.reply( { ephemeral:true, content: 'Sent' })
        }
});
```
Javascript:
```javascript
const { CommandType, commandModule } = require('@sern/handler');
exports.default = commandModule({
        name: 'dm-me',
        type: CommandType.Modal,
        async execute (modal) {
            const value = modal.fields.getTextInputValue('message');
            modal.client.users.fetch('182326315813306368').then( u =>
                u.send(value + ` from ${modal.user}`)
            );
            modal.reply( { ephemeral:true, content: 'Sent' })
        }
});
```
