# Introduction 

Welcome to sern's official guide. This guide will go through all the core features of the framework.
Thank you for choosing sern!

-  Teaching the discord.js library and / or Javascript / Typescript is out of scope of this project, so the documentation assumes you already know these elements.

-  discord.js@dev is the only supported version at the moment. There are plans to roll out a version of sern in discord.js@13.xx.xx in the future.
