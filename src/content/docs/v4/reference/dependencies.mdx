Manage objects which contain lots of state. If you were a previous user of Sapphire, dependency injection is the moral equivalent of `container`.
Dependency injection promotes maintainability and helps organize imports. 

For example, a minimal setup for any project might look like this:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src/
    - index.js **(your main file and client)**
    - **dependencies.d.ts** **(for intellisense)**
</FileTree>



```js title="src/index.js"
const client = new Client({
  ...options,
});

await makeDependencies((root) => {
    root.add("@sern/client", client),
});
```

Everything else is handled. However, you may want customize things.

## Adding Dependencies to Root

Each sern built dependency must implement its contracts:

- `@sern/logger`: Logging data â†’ [`Logging`](/v3/api/interfaces/logging)
- `@sern/errors`: Handling errors and lifetime â†’ [`ErrorHandling`](/v3/api/interfaces/errorhandling)
- `@sern/emitter`: The key to emit events and occurences in a project â†’ [`Emitter`](/v3/api/interfaces/emitter)

## Lifecycle Hooks
Dependencies can call a function throughout you bot's lifetime.

### Init

> Your object needs to initiate things. Developers are allowed to use `async` and `await`.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Do you need to perform intializing behavior for a dependency?
    ```js title="src/database.js"
    import pg from 'pg'
    const { Client } = pg
    class Database {
        __database = new Client()
        async init() {
            await this.__database.connect();
        }
    }
    ```

2. Modify your `Dependencies` interface:
    ```js title="src/dependencies.d.ts" {4}
    import { Database } from './services/database.js'
    interface Dependencies extends CoreDependencies {
        database: Database;
    }
    ```

3. Make sure its been added:
    ```ts title="src/index.ts" {3}
    await makeDependencies(({ add }) => {
        add('database', new Database())
    })
    ```

4. Now, when your bot starts, the `init` method will be called. ðŸŽ‰

</Steps>

### Dispose 
> Your object needs to destroy things before shutdown, if a crash occurs


<Steps>
1. Do you need to perform intializing behavior for a dependency?
    ```js title="src/database.js"
    import pg from 'pg'
    const { Client } = pg
    class Database {
        __database = new Client()
        async init() {
            await this.__database.connect();
        }
        async dispose() {
            console.log("Disposing database")
        }
    }
    ```

3. Make sure its been added:
    ```js title="src/index.ts" {3}
    await makeDependencies(({ add }) => {
        add('database', new Database())
    })
    ```
4. Now, when your bot starts, the `dispose` method will be called. ðŸŽ‰
</Steps>

:::tip
Both `dispose` and `init` are exposed as interfaces in TypeScript. For extra typesafety it may be feasible to implement these interfaces.
```ts
import { type Init } from '@sern/handler'
import pg from 'pg'
const { Client } = pg
class Database implements Init {
    __database = new Client()
    async init() {
        await this.__database.connect();
    }
}
```

## Usage in Commands
> This is for command modules, plugins only. event modules would have to use the `Service` api

Your dependencies are located in SDT.
```ts
export default commandModule({ 
    type: CommandType.Slash,
    execute: (ctx, sdt) =>{
       sdt.deps.database // Database
    }
})
```

## Service
Service api is used for places where sern cannot inject into parameters properly. [View](../../../v3/guide/walkthrough/services/)
