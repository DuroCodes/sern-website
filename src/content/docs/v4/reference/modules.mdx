## Introduction 
sern operates with modules. At its core, Modules contain a `type` field and `execute`, with some code to possibly run before
executing.
### Modules

we'll walk you through creating your first command module.

If you installed a new project via the CLI, your file should be here:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- src/commands/
    - **ping.ts** **(right here, probably)**
- ...
</FileTree>


```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { commandModule, CommandType } from "@sern/handler";

export default commandModule({
  type: CommandType.Both,
  description: "A ping command",
  execute: async (ctx, sdt) => {
    await ctx.reply("Pong 🏓");
  },
});
```
:::tip 
Run `sern commands publish` so discord registers it to your application correctly.
:::

## Modal 
So, lets say you want to make a command module that listens to modals.

:::tip
Keep in mind, you'll need to send a modal with a custom id of `dm-me`. This example below is the response to a modal being sent.
:::

```js title=src/commands/dm-me.js
import { CommandType, commandModule } from "@sern/handler";

export default commandModule({
  type: CommandType.Modal,
  async execute(modal) {
    const value = modal.fields.getTextInputValue("message");
    modal.client.users
      .fetch("182326315813306368")
      .then(usr => usr.send(value + ` from ${modal.user}`));
    modal.reply({ ephemeral: true, content: "Sent" });
  },
});
```
