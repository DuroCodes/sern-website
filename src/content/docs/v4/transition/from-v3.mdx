## Arguments changed for all commands.
> The second argument is the `new SDT` type

```ts {7-10}
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'

export default commandModule({ 
    type: CommandType.Slash,
    description: "My ping command",
    execute: (ctx, sdt) => {
        sdt.params // only exists if current command is not a component
        sdt.deps // Dependencies 
        sdt.type // module type
    }
})
```
:::tip 
To access arguments, use `ctx.options`. 
This getter will return `string[]` if `ctx` is a `Message`, else the discord.js interaction resolver
:::

It used to look like this:
```ts {7-8}
import { commandModule, CommandType } from '@sern/handler'

export default commandModule({ 
    type: CommandType.Slash,
    description: "My ping command",
    execute: (ctx, [type, opts]) => {
       type // 'text' | 'slash' 
       opts // string[] | discord.js command option resolver
    }
})
```

## Killing Experimental Things
> *Sometimes your experiments need to be put behind the barn.*

- `Sern.init('file')` has been removed. 


## Publishing Application Commands
- `sern commands publish` does not work with localizer plugin. It will work in version four, but it is recommended to use
publishing as a [service](/v4/tools/publisher)


## Miscellanous types
- I may have accidentally removed typings Typescript users used. Please alert me if some types have gone missing in our [discord!](https://sern.dev/discord)
